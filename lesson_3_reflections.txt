Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
MAnual management provide deliberation and view of commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

     1: Forking a repository: Make a copy of another repo directly in      G itHub
     2: Forking is a lot like cloning, but it occurs on GitHub. It makes it easy to suggest changes. Forking is only used within context of GitHub.
     3: Branches occur on a SINGLE repository.
     4. When you clone from GitHub to local an association is made with local repo to remote repo.
