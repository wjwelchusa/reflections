When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
There are advantages because then you may distribute your effort.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
MAnual management provide deliberation and view of commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

     1: Forking a repository: Make a copy of another repo directly in      G itHub
     2: Forking is a lot like cloning, but it occurs on GitHub. It makes it easy to suggest changes. Forking is only used within context of GitHub.
     3: Branches occur on a SINGLE repository.
     4. When you clone from GitHub to local an association is made with local repo to remote repo.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Perhaps you had time offline and you wish to work with an up to date version prior to going off line.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Use other techniques described in the course. Not so useful. However, collaborative real time editing similar to PP has value.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Same reason as before. Use a branch as a departure in code - feature, major change big bug.
