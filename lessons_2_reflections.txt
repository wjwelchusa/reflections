What happens when you initialize a repo? Why do you need to do it?

Initial tracking structure begins - no commit yet. Files for tracking in commits identified.

Files added to directory before commit are also included in  'git status'

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is location of files after 'git add'. It is a logical separation and designation of files for pending commits. This allows
modification before commit is complete.
